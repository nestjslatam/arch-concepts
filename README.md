# What we'll be building in this Course

In this course we'll be building a new NestJS application that helps us understand advanced architectural concepts and implementations for our NestJS applications.

## How the course is designed

The course is designed to be incremental.

If you're coding along, make sure to follow through all the lessons & chapters in order. That way you won't miss any tips, best-practices, or code setup's that we might use in future lessons.

## What are we building?

In our application we'll be covering many advanced and powerful Architectural Patterns including:

- Learning about Layered (N-Tier) Architecture
- Three-tier Architecture vs Hexagonal Architecture
- The differences between the two
- Deep-dive into Hexagonal Architecture
- What is Onion Architecture?
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Event Sourcing
- Event Stores

And so much in between, all while using both an in-memory AND a real database for everything.
